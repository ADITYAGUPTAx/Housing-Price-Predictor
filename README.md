## Modeling Approach  

1. **Data Processing**  
   - Removed missing values and outliers  
   - Scaled numerical features  
   - One-hot encoded categorical variables such as location  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Evaluated multiple models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
   - Selected Linear Regression for its strong performance and interpretability  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used: RMSE and RÂ²  
   - The final model achieved reliable performance on the test dataset, suitable for practical use
